                                <p>I'm a creative, passionate, hard-working, dedicated, adventure-seeking, people-loving kind of person. I find great satisfaction in helping others, solving problems, reaching goals, and working towards success. <br>

                                With five years of work experience, I've done a little bit of everything. I have experience managing teams, ensuring client satisfaction, resolving complaints, balancing finances, training team members, and starting and running a business. <br>
                                
                                I'm a skilled photographer with experience in portraiture, sports, events, product, and branding photography. I'm currently enhancing my skills by pursuing a degree in photography. I'm also studying entrepreneurship to learn more about running my own business. <br>

                                Outside of the workplace, I've been heavily involved in my church, service opportunities, humanitarian projects, and school activities. In my free time, I love being outside, hiking, rock climbing, longboarding, playing and watching sports, traveling, spending time with my family, and of course, taking pictures.  </p>
